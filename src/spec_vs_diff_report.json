  "summary": "PlayScreen.tsx was modified to add a CRT/TV frame overlay image above the emulator canvas, but the diff does not show the required new static PNG asset being added, and truncation prevents confirming some overlay interaction/stacking details (e.g., pointer-events and overlay z-order relative to ROM/error overlays).",

      "requirement": "Add the generated TV/CRT frame image asset as a static file at frontend/public/assets/generated/crt-tv-frame.dim_1600x900.png.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, so the required PNG asset is not present in the change set.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the TV/CRT overlay does not intercept pointer events intended for ROM upload controls (use pointer-events: none where appropriate) and that ROM upload/error overlays remain above and clickable.",
      "reason": "PlayScreen.tsx is truncated right where the <img> overlay is added, so the diff summary does not provide evidence of pointer-events settings or confirmed stacking order relative to ROM upload/error overlays.",
